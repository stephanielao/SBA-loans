Starting a new business during the current pandemic and need a loan? Small Business Administration (SBA) loans are among the best financing options for small business owners. Yet, they can be actually highly selective, denying up to hundreds of applications. With the current pandemic we hope business will return to old habits in the future. Therefore, it is crucial that small businesses receive the loans they need to rise back up without defaulting on them. Our goal was to make it so any small business is well-informed and understands their options on getting a loan approved and being able to pay that loan back.

Our overall objectives were to determine what factors tend to cause a loan to be defaulted on and to create a model to predict which approved loan applications will default on their loan. Our target audience consists of consultants who help small businesses grow. In particular, we want to help guide them from an initial idea to the point where they can qualify for a small business loan and be successful enough to not default on it.

Our data analysis consisted of analyzing columns such as industry, approval year, term, and bank. We found that these columns were important in determining defaultness. We then created an XGBoost model to predict which approved loans will default.
